# Review sequence control structures, selection control structures, and repetition control structures. Give an example of each in python.

#Sequences can be:
  #lists assigns multiple variables of data in a specific order that can be stored as well as accessed by each element selected   
  #Byterrays multiple sequence of integers
  #Strings uses a creator designated sequence of charaters, words, or letters
  #tuples uses a mix of elements and is faster when it is large
  #Ranges
  #bytes a range of 0-255

#range example 

temperature = 68
if temperature >70:
    print("turn on air conditioner")
else:
    print("Do not turn on air conditioner")
if temperature <60:
    print("turn on Heater")
else:
    print("Do not turn on heater")

#Sequence control
 #sequence index starts at 0, not 1
  #sequence types: lists, bytearrays, strings, tuples, range, and bytes

x = input(int("X"))
y = input(int("Y")) 

z = x + y print(z) 

#Selection Control

x = input("Enter a number between 0-25:") 

if x > 10: 
    print("x is greater than 10") 
else: print("x is less than or equal to 10") 

#Repitition Control
#Can be set for a number of repetitions or to specific ranges
x = input("enter a number:") 
while x <= 100: 

  print(x) x += 5 

for i in range(100): 
  
  print(i)
